Global settings for line endings
The git config core.autocrlf command is used to change how Git handles line endings. It takes a single argument.

On Windows, you simply pass true to the configuration. For example:

$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
# Configure Git to ensure line endings in files you checkout are correct for Windows.
# For compatibility, line endings are converted to Unix style when you commit files.
